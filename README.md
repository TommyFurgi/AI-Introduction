# AI-Introduction

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and resources for the Concurrency Theory course at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, for the academic year 2024/2025. It covers key topics related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, such as decision trees, neural networks, natural language processing (NLP) architectures, and advanced algorithms. The repository provides practical exercises to enhance understanding of these concepts through hands-on coding.
